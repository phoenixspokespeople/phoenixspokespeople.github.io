## Our mission

Phoenix Spokes People is a non-profit organization dedicated to making Phoenix a friendly, safe, and welcoming place to ride a bike. First organized in November 2012, we have been a registered 501c3 non-profit since June 2015. One of our main goals is to get more bicycle infrastructure in the City of Phoenix and we've been actively involved in communicating our needs to the city, most recently through speaking at the community budget hearings.

We believe that bicycling should be an easily accessible form of transportation for people of all ages, incomes and abilities. We imagine a Phoenix with people dressed up or down &mdash; going to work or heading out for a night on the town &mdash; and getting there safely and comfortably by bike.
