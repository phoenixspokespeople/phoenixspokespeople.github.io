Hey Phoenix bicycle owners! Did you know:

* **Thieves are less likely to steal a registered bicycle** since its owner can easily be identified. Or:
* Bicycle registration aids in identifying the owner in case of a crash, as many bicyclists donâ€™t carry ID, which is especially true of children, and:
* Registering your bicycle increases the likelihood it will be returned to you if recovered.

With these facts in mind, the [Evans Churchill Community Association](https://evanschurchill.org/), [Downtown PHX Farmers Market](https://downtownphoenixfarmersmarket.org), and [Phoenix Police Department](https://www.phoenix.gov/police) have teamed up to provide **FREE bicycle registration** for you, your family, and friends!

Just drop by the Phoenix Public Market any **second Saturday of the month** and all will be taken care of:

* May - Sept: 7 am to 11 am
* Oct - May: 8 am to 1 pm

To expedite the process, consider printing and pre-filling the [**Agreement & Affidavit form**](/images/bike-reg-form.pdf).

Note: **The bike you are registering must be present** (it is not sufficient to fill and drop the form).
