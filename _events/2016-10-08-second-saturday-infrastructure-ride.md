Phoenix Spokes People has branded the month as _Biketober_:

Our ride will highlight some of good, great, and not so great (but getting a BIG upgrage) bicycle infrastructure in Phoenix:

* We will ride the recently improved 15th Avenue bike lanes to the Arizona Canal.
* The AZ Canal has awesome underpasses, and we'll get to ride several of them.
* Work our way in bike lanes to the soon to be improved Grand Canal, and ride a short portion.
* We'll find our way back downtown along 3rd and 5th Avenues and Hance Park.

This ride will be a little longer, about 22 miles, at **a casual, no drop, pace** of about **10 --- 11 mph**.

We have a scheduled break at mile 13.
