Join PSP and [TBAG](http://www.biketempe.org/) for a weekend you'll never forget. We'll start off riding from [Bicycle Nomad Cafe](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) with the Second Saturday group.

We'll visit [Bike Saviours](http://www.bikesaviours.org/) and pick up riders there, then on to our overnight at [Lost Dutchman State Park](https://azstateparks.com/lost-dutchman/). That's a total of 40.4 miles, and there's bike lane almost the whole way!

We'll have friendly bike mechanical-types rolling with the group and a Support and Gear (SAG) vehicle for severe breakdowns or worn-out riders

This ain't your grandma's all-inclusive cushy tour! Bring your own snacks or money for the ride and picnic dinner for Saturday night. Feel free to bring extra to share.

Fee covers camping, breakfast on Sunday, and SAG support. We'll haul your tent, sleeping bag, gear, and whatever food you're not carrying to eat on the way. We've got plenty of space for tents, and two of the three sites have water and electricity.

Optional Saturday afternoon hike up Flatiron, let by Ryan Guzy.

Limit 33 riders. Tell a friend!
