We will be hosting our annual Luminaria Ride though the Willo neighborhood on **Thursday, December 22**.

We'll meet at [Amp Island in Encanto park](https://goo.gl/maps/XDQpCHUUyrL2) at 6:30 for a **7 p.m. rollout**

**Two important things about the ride:**

1. According to the forecast, the chance of rain drops down to 6% at 6:00pm. It'll creep back up to about 18% by 9:00pm, so maybe bring a rain jacket. The ride is on, regardless.
As always, please have a headlight and tail light on your bike. Additional, holiday lighting is highly encouraged!

1. PSP has secured a beer permit, so feel free to bring a festive beverage to the park, if that's your jam. No glass, please.
