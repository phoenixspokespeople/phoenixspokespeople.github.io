We are doing something a bit different for October. Phoenix Spokes People, [T.B.A.G.](http://biketempe.org), and [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) are collaborating for the [Lost Dutchman Overnight (LDO) Bike ride](/events/2017-10-14-lost-dutchman-overnight-ride/). We are going to see them off on their ride to Lost Dutchman in the Superstitions.

We will start at the usual time, meet at 8:00, roll about 9:00. Our destination will be [Bike Saviours](http://www.bikesaviours.org/) in Tempe, about 11 miles away. That will be our break. Those going on the LDO ride will part ways with us there, and the Second Saturday riders will return to Phoenix.

The return trip gives us the opportunity to show off some great bike routes along Galvan Parkway and Papago Park. But, the route may be challenging for those on single speed cruisers, or less accustomed to longer routes. There are a couple mellow climbs up Galvan Parkway and over Oak from 64th Street to about 56th. But it’s downhill from there! It would be about 16 miles back, for a 27-mile day. We'll play it by ear for the return.

If we have consensus for the longer route back, or enough riders to split into two groups, we’ll do it. Light rail is another return option. If not, we’ll head back the way we came which is dead flat except for the bump on Washington between the Grand Canal and Priest.
