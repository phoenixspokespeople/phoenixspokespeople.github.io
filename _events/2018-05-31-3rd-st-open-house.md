# Project Overview
The city of Phoenix Street Transportation Department is hosting an open house meeting to share the latest on the design plans for the 3rd Street Improvement Project and obtain feedback from residents, commuters and business owners. This project is currently in the 30% complete design phase and construction is projected to start fall 2019. Additional opportunities for public input will follow once design plans are 60% complete. The information presented at this open house will be made available on [the project webpage](https://www.phoenix.gov/streets/3rdstreet) following the meeting.

# Project Details
This project is aimed at improving traffic circulation and mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists.

The roadway modifications for 3rd Street include:

* Changing the number of vehicular lanes from two lanes to one lane in each direction with a center turn lane.
* Adding bicycle lanes on both sides of the street. Bicycle lanes will feature a painted buffer with green spot treatments.
* Adding new street lights and adding additional light fixtures to select existing street lights.
* Sidewalk repairs and reconstruction, and new sidewalk in select areas.
* New crosswalks and pedestrian crossing signals.
* ADA accessible curb ramps.
* Landscape enhancements.
