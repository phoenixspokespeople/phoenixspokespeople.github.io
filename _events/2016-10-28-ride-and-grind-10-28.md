With the closure of the Rollover Doughnuts location on Vernon we are changing the Friday morning format a little.
We will be meeting closer to or in downtown Phoenix and focus more on the social aspect at a rotating location.

Arrive when you can, leave when you have to.
Enjoy a morning cup of Joe, maybe a snack or breakfast, and of course great company.

You can post your route and schedule in the comments to coordiante riding to the location with others.

For the October 28th edition we'll meet at [Jobot Coffee and Diner](http://jobotcoffee.com/).
