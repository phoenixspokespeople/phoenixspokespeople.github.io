**Saturday April 15th** at [The Phoenix Ale Brewery](http://phoenixale.com/).

It's a mob scene!

Put on your cuts and colors, and rally your squad, it's going down at the brewery! This year's prom is being taken over by the riff-raff.

Pick your favorite non-threatening fictional gang to represent -- T-Birds, Pink Ladies, Sharks, Jets, Warriors, Drapes -- or create your own.

A spandex syndicate?

A herd of glittery magical unicorns?

Get a crew together and represent; there will be a prize for the best group.

As always, there will be a DJ, dancing, photo booth, a food truck, raffles and prizes, and of course, beer! Keep your peepers peeled for a bike ride to the party as well.

This is a peaceful gathering. Only switchblade combs allowed. Any beef with rival gangs must be settled in a West Side Story type dance off. Squares, stay home with your moms.

Tickets on sale soon! Earlybird pricing: $12 stag, and $20 couple, until April 10th. Full prices are $15/25 afterwards.
