**Saturday April 15th** at [The Phoenix Ale Brewery](http://phoenixale.com/).

It's a mob scene!

Put on your cuts and colors, and rally your squad, it's going down at the brewery! This year's prom is being taken over by the riff-raff.

[#squadgoals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SquadGoals) Pick your favorite non-threatening fictional gang to represent -- T-Birds, Pink Ladies, Sharks, Jets, Warriors, Drapes -- or create your own.

A spandex syndicate? A herd of glittery magical unicorns?

Get a crew together and represent; there will be a prize for the best group.

As always, there will be a DJ, dancing, photo booth, raffles and prizes, and of course, beer! Keep your peepers peeled for a bike ride to the party as well.

We are excited to announce that [What's Fresh?](http://www.whatsfreshaz.com/) will be our food vendor for Bike Prom 2017.
Their menu sounds amazing, and we can't wait to dig in to their eats to refuel after the ride to the prom, and to fuel up for the "Rumble at the Prom" shenanigans!

This is a peaceful gathering. Only switchblade combs allowed. Any beef with rival gangs must be settled in a West Side Story type dance off. Squares, stay home with your moms.

Tickets on sale soon! Earlybird pricing: $12 stag, and $20 couple, until April 10th. Full prices are $15/25 afterwards.

And remember: Our members receive a $5 discount! [Support us here](https://plasso.com/s/9Tlekqlz7y).
