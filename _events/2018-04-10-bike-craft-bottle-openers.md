In honor of [Valley Bike Month](https://www.valleymetro.org/valley-bike-month), we're partnering with Valley Metro to offer a fun upcycling event, using old bicycle bits to craft into handy and unique bottle openers.

Sparks are gonna fly!

We will be using angle grinders, rotary tools, saws -- whatever it takes to get the job done. They are very sharp and loud and throw scary sparks and pointy things.

Therefore, this project is for grown-ups only, and you must wear pants and closed-toe shoes. Long sleeves are also recommended, but we will have some long gloves available, if you absolutely must bare arms. We will have some very chic safety glasses for you to use.

BONUS CRAFT! If you would rather, or would also, like to make bike part keychains, Sue Patterson will be teaching us how.

Because of the limited number of tools available, the bottle opener craft is capped at 8 attendees. 10-15 people can work on keychains.

Materials fee is $10, payable at the door.

Disclosure: this project is trickier than you would think, so you might not end up with a bottle opener that actually functions well. But we're going to try like heck. It will be guaranteed to look really cool, and you'll have a fun time making it.
