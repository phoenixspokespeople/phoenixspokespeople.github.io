We will be hosting our annual Luminaria Ride though the Willo neighborhood on **Sunday, December 23rd**.
It's an easy family-friendly ride around the neighborhood to enjoy the luminarias when it gets dark.

We'll meet at [Walton Park](https://goo.gl/maps/H2fsV4sbJQt), at 3rd Ave. & Holly for a **6:30 p.m. rollout**

The First Place Coffee truck will be at the park from 5 to 8 p.m. selling hot chocolate and other warm beverages.
