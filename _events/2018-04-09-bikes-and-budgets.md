It's that time of the year again, time to politely remind the City of Phoenix that we ride bikes, and they have a duty to let us do it safely and comfortably.

Never been to a budget hearing? It's easy:
Just turn up, fill in a card to request to speak, and hop up and tell them you'd like more money to be spent on bike infrastructure.
[Last year's was spectacularly empty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGY0j50Mqog&index=4&list=PL22YB12L5NbQsC6h5t6Pd4q_1OkmGZFTm), so if we can mob them with bike fam then they'll have no choice but to listen!

Here's the official website: https://www.phoenix.gov/budget

Once we're done making our point, join Phoenix Downtempo's ride and feel good about doing some democracy!
