With the closure of the Rollover Doughnuts location on Vernon we are changing the Friday morning format a little.
We will be meeting closer to or in downtown Phoenix and focus more on the social aspect at a rotating location.

Arrive when you can, leave when you have to.
Enjoy a morning cup of Joe, maybe a snack or breakfast, and of course great company.

For the October 14th edition we'll meet at the Cafe at [Phoenix Public Market](http://www.phxpublicmarket.com/), a favorite among many of us.
