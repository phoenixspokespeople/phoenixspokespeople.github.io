It's not Bike Prom with out the Bike Prom Parade to The Phoenix Ale Brewery. 

Meet at Civic Space Park starting at **5:30**.

Hang out with your fellow prom goers for a bit, let's just keep the rumbles civil please. 

If you bought your tickets in advance and have your ID, you can check-in before the ride, get your wristband, and skip the line at the brewery.

We will leave promptly (tee-hee) at **6:15** for the 4.25 mile ride to the brewery.

We will organize a ride back downtown at the close of Bike Prom 2017. Details for that at the event.

See you there.
