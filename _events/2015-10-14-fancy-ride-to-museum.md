Put on your fancy clothes and join us for the FREE night at the [Phoenix Art Museum](http://www.phxart.org/).

We'll, of course, stop for a fine cocktail and hors d'oeuvres along the way (place TBD).

* Meet us in front of the [Burton Barr Central Library](https://goo.gl/maps/dWkag71w1gP2).
* We'll plan to roll out at 5:30 pm and will arrive at the museum at 7:30 pm.
