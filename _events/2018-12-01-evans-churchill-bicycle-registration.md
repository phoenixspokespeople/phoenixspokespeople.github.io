Hey Phoenix bicycle owners! Did you know:

* **Thieves are less likely to steal a registered bicycle** since its owner can easily be identified. Or:
* Bicycle registration aids in identifying the owner in case of a crash, as many bicyclists don’t carry ID, which is especially true of children, and:
* Registering your bicycle increases the likelihood it will be returned to you if recovered.

With these facts in mind, the [Evans Churchill Community Association](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjvpIeAuZfQAhXnslQKHe0GCQMQFggdMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fevanschurchill.org%2F&usg=AFQjCNF_dyUhCfOV_jEZBi9qK3nNdkN9WA&sig2=vMOI7E-_q_5CRfAfxIA-Lw), [Phoenix Public Market](http://www.phxpublicmarket.com/), [Phoenix Union Bioscience High School](http://www.phxhs.k12.az.us/bioscience), and [Phoenix Police Department](https://www.phoenix.gov/police) are teaming up provide **FREE bicycle registration** for you, your family, and friends!

Just drop by the Phoenix Public Market on **Saturday, December 1st**, from **8 a.m. to noon**, and all will be taken care of.

Useful bicycle safety information, tchotchkes, and Q&A are also on tap! Under the Evans Churchill tent, just look for friendly neighborhood and student volunteers – and City of Phoenix police officers who manage the City's bicycle registration program.
