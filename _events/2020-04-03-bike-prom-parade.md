Get your sequins and glitter ready! This year's Bike Prom is kicking off Phoenix Pride weekend at Crescent Ballroom with a rainbow spectacular Dirty Disco Bike Prom! We'll glam out with a show by The AZ Gender Outlaws + HI-DREAMS DJ Collective

Dress up in your most fabulous sparkly rainbow prom attire, or make your disco dreams come true with some flared hot pants, crop tops, and rhinestones. Look your best and bring that dirty disco attitude for a chance to take home prizes for Hottest Look, Royal Couple, Best Disco Dance Queen/King!

There will also be a raffle with some great prizes! This event is benefiting the Rusty Spoke Community Bicycle Collective.

Join Phoenix Spokes People and Phoenix Downtempo Ride for a bike parade to the event! We'll start gathering at Civic Space Park at 6pm and roll out around 7pm, cycling majestically through downtown in all our Bike Prom glory. The festivities and drag show at Crescent begin at 8pm for anyone who wants to meet us there and join in the fun!
