**Saturday, Jan 12th.** Time and location TBD.

Help Us Make Phoenix a better place to ride bikes!

Bike-friendly streets and successful events don't happen by accident; there are threats and opportunities all around. Join other bike lovers to hear the latest news and get involved.

Everyone is welcome. We hope to see you there!

Can't wait that long? [Watch our July meeting here](https://youtu.be/pGNYuBoPe9c).
