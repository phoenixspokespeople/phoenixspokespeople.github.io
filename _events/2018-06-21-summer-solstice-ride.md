Holy Blazing Saddles, it's the first day of summer! Join us for a sunset ride and squirt gun shenanigans.

Gather *around* 7:00 on the north side of Bird Lake, near the restrooms and sand volleyball courts. We'll do a Summer Solstice Sunset photo at 7:40 and roll after that.

Bring lights, a lock, and money for refreshments. Squirt guns are encouraged; they sell them at the Dollar store!

We'll do a casual 8 - 10 miles, ending at [McKenzie's Midtown Tavern](https://www.mckenziesmidtown.com/) where it's happy hour all day if you arrive by bike.

Careful! **Steele Indian School Park closes at 10 p.m.and they're not shy about locking cars in**.
