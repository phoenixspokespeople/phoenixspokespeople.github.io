From the City of Phoenix:

*The proposed safety modifications for Osborn Road include the removal
of one vehicular-travel lane in each direction. Reducing travel lanes
allows the roadway to be repurposed to include design elements such as a
center-turn lane and buffered bike lanes. Such design elements would
help create a safer environment for all users of the roadway, add
greater connectivity to area activity centers and improve bicycle lane
connectivity.  The new proposed bike lanes connect to existing bike
lanes on Osborn Road east of 19th Avenue and existing bike lanes on 15th
Avenue.*
