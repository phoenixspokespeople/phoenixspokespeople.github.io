**Saturday, Feb 9th**

**8:00 am**

Phoenix Spokes People and [Bicycle Nomad Caf√©](https://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) Second Saturday Bike Ride.

Our host (slacker) is running behind this month.  April is Valley Bike
Month, so we may do something a little different for this event to
celebrate biking in the Valley.  Stay tuned.

We'll meet at 8:00, roll about 9:00.  Take a ride through town.  A break
at half-way.  We'll post a tentative route soon.

Come on out and enjoy the lovely weather in Phoenix.  Bring your
friends. And sunscreen.

Can't wait to see you there.
