**Saturday, May 14th**

**8:00 am**

This month we are returning to our regular format, and doing the orignal Bicycle Nomad Café route from Black Friday. 

We'll have a nice ride though historic neighborhoods, down Lower Grand Avenue, around the Capitol complex, along the Rio Salado Habitat, and back into downtown.

Meet at Bicycle Nomad Café in The Velo Bike Shop at 8:00 for socializing with coffee, treats from Nami, and other snacks available for purchase. 

We'll roll out about 9:00 for this casual paced, no drop ride of about 16 miles. We'll take a break around halfway with restrooms, water fountains, and nice views.
