## Saturday, Oct 7th

This year New Belgium Brewery is suporting local nonprofits with the first ever Cyclovia event in Tempe!

From **Noon until 3pm** (when the concert starts at Tempe Town Lake) Mill Ave will be closed to motorized traffic from University to 3rd street! People walking or riding bikes will be able to ride all over! There will be music, activities, fun, and specials at your favorite local businesses!

Join Tempe Bicycle Action Group, Phoenix Spokes People, Bike Saviours, Rusty Spoke, the Mountain Bike Association of Arizona, the Central Arizona Mountain Bike Patrol and their friends in a unique event celebrating bikes, culture, art, and music on a street you normally hate to drive down!

Join **the Bike Parade lineup at 11am and launching at noon**, stay for the Cyclovia, and at 3pm join us for Michael Franti & Spearhead at Tempe Town Lake - gates open at 3pm, when the Cyclovia ends!
