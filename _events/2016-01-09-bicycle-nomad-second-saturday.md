**Saturday, Janurary 9**

**8:00 am**

The Black Friday Ride was a huge success, lots of people asked when we'd do it again. Well, we plan to do it every month on second Saturdays.

We will meet at 8 a.m. to socialize and enjoy Bicycle Nomad Café’s coffee & smoothies, treats from Nami, and other drinks and snacks available for sale. 

We will plan to **roll about 9:00** for a casual paced, no-drop ride of about 19 miles. This time we will ride on new and old bicycle infrastructure though a few Phoenix neighborhoods. 

We will come out of the shop, through downtown on the Green Lane on Fillmore Street. Down to Grand Avenue and then the great Green Bike Lanes up to 15th Avenue. Ride up the wonderful flarelanelessness (that's a word) to Maryland. Under SR51 via one of the best freeway crossings before we take our midway break in Granada Park. 

We will work our way back downtown via more bike lanes, a less wonderful freeway crossing, a short bit on the Grand Canal, Steele Indian School Park, Phoenix Sonoran Bikeway, Hance Park, and back to the Bicycle Nomad Café in [The Velo Bicycle Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/).

Can't wait to see you all there!
