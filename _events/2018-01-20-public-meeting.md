Help Us Make Phoenix a better place to ride bikes!

Bike-friendly streets and successful events don't happen by accident; there are threats and opportunities all around. Join other bike lovers to hear the latest news get involved.

Many thanks to [Downtown Phoenix Inc](http://dtphx.org/) for hosting us at their rad CityScape offices.

Bring a snack or beverage to share. If you're riding to the meeting consider posting your route so others can join you.
