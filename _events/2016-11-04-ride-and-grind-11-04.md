With the closure of the Rollover Doughnuts location on Vernon we are changing the Friday morning format a little.
We will be meeting closer to or in downtown Phoenix and focus more on the social aspect at a rotating location.

Arrive when you can, leave when you have to.
Enjoy a morning cup of Joe, maybe a snack or breakfast, and of course great company.

For November 4th we'll meet at The Grand Central Coffee Company.
