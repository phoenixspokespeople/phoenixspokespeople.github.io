Beer secret santa!
===

This year, we're doing something a little different. We will have an
alcohol permit, and would love for you to bring a **can** of tasty beer
to share in a secret santa. *(No bottles, please!)*

Bring anything else you'd like to eat or drink yourself.

We will provide treats for attendees, but be sure to grab a real meal ahead of time.
