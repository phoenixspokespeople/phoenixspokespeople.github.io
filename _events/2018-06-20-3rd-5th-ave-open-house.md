At a public open house on **June 20, 2018**, the city of Phoenix Street Transportation Department will provide details on final designs for safety and mobility improvements for 3rd and 5th avenues between McDowell Road and Washington Street.

A pre-design study was conducted in 2016 to obtain advice and insight from stakeholders and neighborhoods. Throughout the design process, the City directly involved the community to participate in various public input opportunities, including a three-day interactive workshop. Through this extensive community involvement process, a preferred alternative was developed which has been evaluated and refined in the final design phase.

Details of the final design to be presented for public review on June 20, 2018 include converting 3rd and 5th avenues to two-way streets between Roosevelt Street and Washington Street. Between McDowell Road and Roosevelt Street, a lane will be reduced and the existing one-way vehicle flow will be maintained. For bicyclists, the existing southbound bicycle lane will remain on 5th Avenue, while two-way accommodation will be added on 3rd Avenue, including a new two-way cycle track from McDowell Road to Roosevelt Street. On-street parking will be maintained throughout the corridor, with additional parking where possible. The design also reflects numerous specific pedestrian safety enhancements.

> 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
> Wednesday, June 20, 2018
> A.E. England Building, 424 N. Central Ave.
