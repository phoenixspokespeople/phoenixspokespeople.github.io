**July 29th at 7pm**

Join us for the third annual Blazing Saddles night ride. Meet at 7 by the lake, roll *around* 7:30. Sunset is at 7:31 and the forecast high is 105, so 12 degrees cooler than at posting. Piece of cake!

Route is TBA, but we'll ride 10 to 12 miles with a stop or two for refueling. It's a sure bet there will be cold drinks, ice cream, and shenanigans involved. Squirt guns optional; lights required. Bring locks, water and money too.

See you there!
