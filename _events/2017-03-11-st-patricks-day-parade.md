We are doing something a little different this month, riding in a Parade. [The Saint Patrick’s Day Parade](http://stpatricksdayphoenix.org/).

* Join us at at **8:00 a.m.** at [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) for coffee and snacks.

* Will have to leave *promptly* at 9:00 to ride over to the SPD Parade staging area on [3rd Street and Sheridan](https://goo.gl/maps/cSMA6fXhhbQ2).

* The parade will start at 10:00, will be a little later before we start actually rolling.

Hanging out in the staging area can be a lot of fun as we wait for the start. Save some of your coffee, bring some treats.

Make sure to wear green, St. Patrick’s Day it up. Decorate your bike. Have a bell or horn on your bike. If you’ve never ridden in a parade before it’s an absolute blast. Have as much fun with it as you’d like.
