**Sunday, December 17th**

**4:00 p.m.**

Grab your Santa hat or reindeer antlers, don your ugliest holiday sweater, and join us for the Downtown Pedal Around Holiday Ride on Sunday, Dec. 17, beginning at 4 p.m.

We'll leave from [Civic Space Park](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/alphabetical/c-parks/civic-space), and after navigating through the city and the rules of the road, we'll reward ourselves with some delicious food and drinks at [Chico Malo](https://www.chicomalo.com/).
