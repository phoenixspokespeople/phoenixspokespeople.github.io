Join us to hear the latest downtown and central Phoenix bike news including updates on Streets projects, light rail and an exciting announcement from our friends at Downtown Phoenix, AZ.

We'll have coffee, light snacks and cold, filtered water for your refillable vessel. Feel free to bring a snack to share.

Agenda will be posted here in advance. Look for it about a day ahead of time (we're volunteers!)
