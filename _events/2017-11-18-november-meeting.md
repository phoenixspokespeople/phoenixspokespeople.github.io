Help Us Make Bike Magic!

Great events and successful advocacy don't happen by accident. Join us to hear the latest news get involved. 

We're meeting in the Valley Metro ofices, in the US Bank Building on First Avenue between Adams and Monroe, in the 10th Floor Lake Mead conference room.

There is bike parking at the meters around the building. To bring your bike inside, use the service entrance off the alley opposite Valley Bar and buzz Security for access to the freight elevator.

Stop by the Public Market on your way and bring a snack to share. We'll have soda and cold, filtered water for your refillable container. Members and non-members welcome!
