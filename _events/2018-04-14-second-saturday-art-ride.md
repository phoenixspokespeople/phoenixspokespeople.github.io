**Saturday, April 14th**

**8:00 am**

Phoenix Spokes People and [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) Second Saturday Bike Ride.

We will meet at Bicycle Nomad Café inside [The Velo Bike Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/) at 8:00 to hang out with their amazing coffee, treats from Nami, and other items available for purchase.

Details are being worked out still, but we will be taking a tour of Public Art downtown and central Phoenix.

We will meet at the café at 8:00 for coffee, snacks, and of course good company.

Roll about 9:00 for a (TBD) ride of 15-18 miles. We will take our usual break around halfway at a park with bathrooms.

Hope to see you there!
