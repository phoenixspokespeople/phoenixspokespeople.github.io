**Friday, November 25**

**8:00 am**

In the spirit of REI’s “Opt Outside” let’s skip the shopping malls and go for a bike ride on Black Friday morning.

Join us for a Turkey (or Tofurkey) Burning social ride starting with our friends at
Bicycle Nomad Café in The [Velo Bicycle Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/).

**We will meet at 8 a.m.** to socialize and enjoy Bicycle Nomad Café’s coffee & smoothies, treats from Nami, and other drinks and snacks available for sale.

We will plan to roll about 9:00 for a casual paced, **no-drop ride of about 17 miles**.

We will ride through downtown Phoenix, Margaret T. Hance Park, Willo Neighborhood, Encanto Neighborhood, Lower Grand Avenue, around the State Capitol Complex, and tour the Rio Salado Habitat before rolling back downtown and to the Bicycle Nomad Café in The Velo Bicycle Shop:
