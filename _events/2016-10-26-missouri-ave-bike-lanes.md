From the City of Phoenix:

*The city of Phoenix Street Transportation Department is proposing to reduce the number of lanes on Missouri Avenue between 19th Avenue and 24th Street to make the road safer for pedestrians, cyclists and drivers. The proposed plans provide space to install bike lanes on both sides of the road and reduce the number of travel lanes for pedestrians crossing Missouri Avenue. Existing and projected traffic count volumes and accident rates were evaluated to develop the proposed plans for Missouri Avenue.*

*Please attend this public meeting to learn more about the proposed plans for Missouri Avenue and to share your input.*

*The information presented at this meeting will be made available online at phoenix.gov/street/projects following the meeting.*
