# East Side Edition

**Saturday, December 10th**

**8:00 am**

Join Phoenix Spokes People and [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) Second Saturday Bike Ride.

The route will be posted soon. Expect to ride through neighborhoods and on bicycle infrastructure on the east side of town this month.

We will stop by the [Brass Monkey Bike Shop](http://www.brassmonkeybikeshop.com/) and pop in on the Bicycle Swap Meet that they are hosting with [Rusty Spoke Community Bicycle Collective](http://www.rustyspoke.org).

Roll about 9:00. This ride will be about 16 miles, at a casual, no drop, pace of about 10~11 mph. We have a scheduled break around the middle.
