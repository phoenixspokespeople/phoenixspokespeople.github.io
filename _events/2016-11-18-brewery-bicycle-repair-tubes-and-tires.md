Admission is **$10** and **includes one pint of the fantastic beer** from Helton Brewing Company.

The first workshop will cover Tubes and Tires. We will teach you how to correctly remove the wheels from the bicycle. Remove the tires from the wheels. Replace or repair the inner tube. Then we will put it all back together.

You are encouraged to bring your bicycle to the brewery and work on it as we lead the workshop. We will provide the tools and equipment. If time permits, we can explore other areas of maintenance and repair.

Please send an RSVP to [Bill at the Rusty Spoke](bill@rustyspoke.org) if you plan to attend.
