Join Phoenix Spooks People as we ride with the undead as part of Zombie Walk 7!

The Zombie Walk festivites begin at **2 pm** and we'll gather at **6 pm** when the walk begins (with more details to come). Please bring a food donation for St. Mary's Food Bank and don't forget to dress the part!

[More info on Zombie Walk 7 (be sure to RSVP here as well!)](https://www.facebook.com/events/394364484086487/)

Phoenix Spooks People will ride in front of the walkers.

See you then!

There will be a Lil Zombie Zone, Goodwill Arizona Zombification Zone, Four Peaks Beer Gardens and Rebel Lounge Main Stage featuring Alien Ant Farm. The 1.5-mile zombie walk through Downtown Phoenix will be led by Grand Marshal John Holmberg from KUPDâ€™s Morning Sickness.
