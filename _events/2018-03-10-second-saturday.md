**Saturday, March 10th**

**8:00 am**

Phoenix Spokes People and [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) Second Saturday Bike Ride.

We will meet at Bicycle Nomad Café inside [The Velo Bike Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/) at 8:00 to hang out with their amazing coffee, treats from Nami, and other items available for purchase.

Join us for our monthly shenanigans. Route will be figured out and posted in the next couple days.

We will meet at the café at 8:00 for coffee, snacks, and of course good company.

Roll about 9:00 for a (TBD) ride of 15-18 miles. We will take our usual break around halfway at a park with bathrooms.

Hope to see you there!
