With the closure of the Rollover Doughnuts location on Vernon we are changing the Friday morning format a little.
We will be meeting closer to or in downtown Phoenix and focus more on the social aspect at a rotating location.

Arrive when you can, leave when you have to.
Enjoy a morning cup of Joe, maybe a snack or breakfast, and of course great company.


For the October 21st edition we'll meet at the [be Coffee + Food + Stuff](http://www.conceptuallysocial.com/) in the MonOrchid Gallery.
