We are doing something a bit different for November. [Bicycle Nomad Caf√©](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) is putting on the [Bicycle Nomad Film Festival](http://www.thefilmbarphx.com/movie/bicycle-nomad-film-festival) at neighboring FilmBar starting at 5 p.m.

We will be meeting at **1:00 p.m.** for a **2:00 p.m. departure**. Usual distance for a ride around town. About 15 miles, casual, no drop ride.

We'll plan to be back about 4:00 to have a little time before the Film Festival.

Please consider [getting a ticket](http://www.thefilmbarphx.com/movie/bicycle-nomad-film-festival) for the Bicycle Nomad Film Festival and extending your time with us after the ride.

Phoenix Spokes People will be providing Bicycle Valet at FilmBar for the event.

We will go back to the usual format for December.
