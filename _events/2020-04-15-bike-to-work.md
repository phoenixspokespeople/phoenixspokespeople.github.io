Join employees of Maricopa County, the City of Phoenix, and the State of Arizona at the annual Bike to Work Day. County and City officials will host a bike ride and light breakfast in downtown Phoenix with the goal of inspiring citizens to increase their movement and decrease pollution. Everyone is welcome to join the ride regardless of their bike-riding experience and fitness level. Participants will need to bring their own bikes, or use the Social Bicycle app to find and rent a bike.

Participants may choose to ride with a large police-escorted group from midtown Phoenix to City Hall Plaza (next to the Orpheum Theater), or to ride directly to City Hall Plaza at 200 W. Washington St. Riders who register by April 8 will get a free breakfast, a t-shirt and be included in the raffle for prizes.

Everyone is invited to visit City Hall Plaza to hear speakers, cheer on the riders, and support the bicycle community. Community volunteers will be on hand to promote health, fitness, safety, bicycle commuting, clean air, and more! Come out and join us.
