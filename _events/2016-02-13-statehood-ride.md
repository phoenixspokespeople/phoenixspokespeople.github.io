Join us for a history tour around Phoenix as we visit some of the structures that have been around for over 100 years.(Yes, there are still a few of those standing here!)

We'll meet at **8 a.m.** at [Bicycle Nomad Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/ivCSUT3dxs42) for some tasty treats and coffee, then **roll out for an easygoing ride at 9 a.m.**.

More details to come!
