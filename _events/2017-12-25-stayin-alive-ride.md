Phoenix Spokes People is providing lights to give away to all those ninja riders out there.

Being seen on your bike is one of the most important parts of safe cycling. We will be riding around downtown searching for bikers in need of lights! The [City of Phoenix](phoenix.gov) is also donating a bunch of reflective stickers we can pass out as well!

After your Christmas day celebrations come hang out with the Downtempo crew and have some fun doing some good!
