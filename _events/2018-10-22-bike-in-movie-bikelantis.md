> BIKELANTIS is an exploration of bike friendliness and how cycling is changing communities. Lafayette, Indiana is featured as a vibrant, cycling community where biking is evolving and the Hood Ride Bicycle Shop in Phoenix, Arizona is showcased as an example of a fully realized bicycle habitat.

> Since 2012, Director/Producer Manny Cervantes was working hard on accomplishing one of his dreams, a feature documentary on bicycle culture around the United States. He toured the country for over two years, chronicling his various tours and interviewing cyclists of all stripes to get a perspective on what is advancing cycling in their specific cities.
