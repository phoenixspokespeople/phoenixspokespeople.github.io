**Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017**, from **6 p.m. to 8 p.m.** at [AASK, 2320 N. 20th St](https://goo.gl/maps/rRA9CUMqFxn).

As part an effort to make the cityâ€™s roadways safer for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians while improve connections with transit,
the City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department is proposing a series of transportation improvements for **Oak Street**.

While maintaining current vehicular lanes, the proposed improvements include sidewalks, enhanced lighting, improved signage,
as well as bicycle lanes and two-way cycle tracks along **Oak Street from Third Street to 20th Street** and along **20th Street from Oak Street to the Grand Canal**.

The proposed project will greatly enhance connectivity with existing and planned bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure and transit service for this transportation corridor.
Additional improvements include traffic calming measures at key locations and improved major street crossings.
The city identified Oak Street for **bicycle and pedestrian facility improvements** because as a collector street it is part of the city grid system, and has lower vehicle counts than arterial streets to the north and south.

The proposed improvements for Oak Street include:

* Two-way cycle track where suitable
* Bike lanes on segments without cycle track
* Sidewalks
* Intersection pavement markings and improvements
* Signage
* Street lighting
* Traffic calming applications to slow vehicular traffic
* Improved drainage
* Modified and improved crossings at Seventh Street, 16th Street and Thomas Road
* Improved connectivity to the Grand Canal and future 20th Street bike improvements
* Improved connectivity to local transit routes

Residents, property owners and business owners are [invited to attend an open house](https://www.phoenix.gov/news/streets/1628) to review the proposed design plans for Oak Street and provide input.

The open house will be held **Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017**, from **6 p.m. to 8 p.m.** at AASK, 2320 N. 20th St.
