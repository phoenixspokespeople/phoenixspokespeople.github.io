**Tuesday, Dec. 13, 9 a.m. â€“ 11 a.m.**


The meeting will be held in first-floor assembly rooms A, B and C at [Phoenix City Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/CnF5937wkRs).

The design for the bike lanes on 3rd and 5th Avenue in Midtown and Downtown Phoenix are going into the final design phase.

While we're happy with some aspects of it and would like to see the addition of a cycle track, it does call for the **removal of the bike lane of 5th Avenue south of Roosevelt**.

We've heard from many people who ride bikes that they do not want to see the bike lane removed and we agree.

Please consider attending this meeting and speaking or you can stop by at the start of the meeting to fill out a comment card to share your thoughts.
