**Oct 29th, 11 a.m. -- 2 p.m.**

Let's start the sweets binge a little early, with a ride featuring candy, cupcakes, cookies, and ice cream!

We're getting our sweets on at:

* [Dulceria Pico Rico](https://goo.gl/maps/U4joaSxssjK2),
* [Urban Cookies](http://urbancookies.com/index.html), and ending at:
* [Churn](http://churnaz.com/) (and/or Windsor, if you would like to finish with some grownup food and beverage).

The route is about 10 miles one way. If you need to return to Encanto Park, it's an additional 4 miles.

Since it's so close to Halloween, costumes or any other bright / festive attire encouraged!

Meet on Amp Island at Encanto Park at **11:00 a.m.** for socializing and maybe some treats, and roll out by **11:45**.
