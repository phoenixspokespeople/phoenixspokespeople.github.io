FilmBar's Bike-In Movies is presented with support from Phoenix Spokes People and [Phoenix Downtempo Ride](http://downtempo.bike)!

Two worlds collide when cycling legend Jonathan "Jock" Boyer moves to Rwanda to help the first Rwandan National Cycling Team in their six year journey to compete in the Olympic Games. Against impossible odds both Jock and the team find new purpose as they rise from the ashes of their past.

Stunningly filmed, Rising From Ashes follows Jock (the first American to compete in the Tour de France) and his Rwandan riders as they slowly learn what it means to be a professional cyclist - how to train, compete, and live the life of a top level athlete. As their strength and confidence grows, the riders of Team Rwanda give their fellow citizens a vision of something greater than themselves and their history: hope for a future.

Executive produced and narrated by Forest Whitaker (Lee Daniels' The Butler, The Last King of Scotland).

A portion of the proceeds to benefit the Phoenix Spokes People.
