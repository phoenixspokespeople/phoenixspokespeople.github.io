**Sunday, Feb 17th**

**3 p.m. -- 5 p.m.**

Downtown Pedal Around is turning two! ðŸš²ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚  Celebrate downtown's growing bike culture with us on Sunday, Feb. 17 at our community bike ride around #dtphx.

On this ride you'll explore downtown neighborhoods like Garfield,
Coronado, Willo -- and see the beautiful murals in the Oak Street Alley.

Riders who join us from start to finish will also get the chance to score some cool #dtphx merch. ðŸ˜Ž

We'll leave from [Civic Space Park](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/alphabetical/c-parks/civic-space) at **3 p.m.**, and ride for about an hour, and reward ourselves with food and drinks at a local eatery -- decided by YOU! Stay tuned for a poll.
