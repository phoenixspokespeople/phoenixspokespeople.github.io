Join Phoenix Spokes People On Friday, Sept. 16, as parking spaces around the globe are temporarily reclaimed for people!

*Our 8th annual PARK(ing) Day PHX is a day for community activists,
neighborhood leaders and urban planners throughout the city to step up
to the curb-literally, to put a quarter in the meter, and transform
metered parking spaces into temporary public parks and other social
spaces, as part of an annual event called "PARK(ing) Day" that takes
place in cities around the globe.*
