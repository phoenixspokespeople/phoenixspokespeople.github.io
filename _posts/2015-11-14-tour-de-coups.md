Join Phoenix Spokes People and [Valley Permaculture Alliance](http://vpaaz.org/)
on **November 14th** as we visit the coops and learn from feathered friends
about chicken health, coop construction, and incorporating chickens into
your backyard system & garden!

This guided bicycle Tour is sure something to BAWK about! Check out the cutest chicks in town on this tour of backyard chicken coops in greater downtown Phoenix!

Here's the scoop on this year's eggcellent route: the bicycle tour will be guided and led by experienced urban cyclists from Phoenix Spokes People.

**Where to go**:
the Bike Tour begins at Tour Headquarters ([2225 N 16th St](https://goo.gl/maps/x2AEDtW8E1p)).

**When to be there**:
please arrive by *8:45am* to check in, be present for the safety talk, and tour the first coop at HQ. We ride promptly at *9:30am*.

**What to expect**:
the bike tour will be at a slow pace, but you should expect to bike for 18 miles, with about 2 hours of saddle time -- this ride is NOT friendly for small children or roller blades.
There will be a 1 hour no-host lunch in the middle of the ride.
