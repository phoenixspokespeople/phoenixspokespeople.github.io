April is [Valley Bike Month](http://www.valleymetro.org/campaigns_contests/valley_bike_month), celebrate with a bike tour of public art in downtown Phoenix!

We'll meet at the usual **8:00 am** for socializing and incredible coffee served by [Bicycle Nomad Caf√© in The Velo Bike Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html), sweets from nami along with other treats available for sale.

We'll roll out at **9:00 am** for about an 8 mile tour of public art, finishing up back at The Velo. See you then!
