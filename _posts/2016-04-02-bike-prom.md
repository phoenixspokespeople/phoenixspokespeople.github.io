**Saturday April 2nd** at [The Phoenix Ale Brewery](http://phoenixale.com/).

Was your first prom not-so-perfect?

High school not your favorite time in general?

*Here's your chance at a redo surrounded by bicycle-riding misfits and craft beer!*

We'll have a DJ, food trucks, craft beer and more fun than you can imagine. 

A **bike parade** to the event gathers at [Civic Space Park, in downtown Phoenix](https://goo.gl/maps/yLyc4PMKCjr) at **6pm**.

This year we'll have a 60's theme, *[Chain of Fools](https://youtu.be/tHeqFxHSVfA)*, to help you plan your outfit --- so get to it (there will be prizes)!
We'll also choose a Prom King and Queen and will award the best dancers --- so practice those moves.
