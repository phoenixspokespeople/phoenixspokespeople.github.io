**Saturday April 2nd** at [The Phoenix Ale Brewery](http://phoenixale.com/).

Was your first prom not-so-perfect?
High school not your favorite time in general?

*Here's your chance at a redo surrounded by bicycle-riding misfits and craft beer!*

<!-- LightWidget WIDGET --><script src="//lightwidget.com/widgets/lightwidget.js"></script><iframe src="//lightwidget.com/widgets/894ed7363f7e53f6aafc9e0cb9f0a9e2.html" id="lightwidget_894ed7363f" name="lightwidget_894ed7363f"  scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true" class="lightwidget-widget" style="width: 100%; border: 0; overflow: hidden;"></iframe>


We have a DJ, food trucks, craft beer and more fun than you can imagine.
<br>
*And* a **bike parade** to the event gathers at [Civic Space Park, in downtown Phoenix](https://goo.gl/maps/yLyc4PMKCjr) at **6pm**.
<br>
*And* we'll be choosing a **Prom King and Queen**.
<br>
*And* prizes for the best outfits, dancers, and our 2016 King and Queen.

All this for only **$20** for a couple, or **$12** for a single.
<br>

Want to avoid *waiting in line*, an *increased ticket price* ($15 per person), and **impress your date**?
<br>
Then <a href="https://plasso.co/s/cd1RoOoftr" class="plo-button">get your tickets online</a> right now.

This year we'll have a 60's theme, *[Chain of Fools](https://youtu.be/tHeqFxHSVfA)*, to help you plan your outfit --- so get to it!
