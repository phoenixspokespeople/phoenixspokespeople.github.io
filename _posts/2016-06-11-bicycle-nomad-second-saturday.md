**Saturday, June 11th**

**8:00 am**

Phoenix Spokes People and [Bicycle Nomad Café](http://www.thevelo.com/cafe.html) Second Saturday Bike Ride.

As the temps rise, we are going to shorten the route a little.
Still with a half-way break. This month will be about 12 miles at a casual, no-drop pace.

We will meet at Bicycle Nomad Café inside [The Velo Bike Shop](http://www.thevelo.com/) at 8:00 to hang out with their amazing coffee, treats from Nami, and other items available for purchase.

We will plan to roll out about **9:00**.
