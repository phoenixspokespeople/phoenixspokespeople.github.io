**Sunday, December 13**

**1:30pm - 8:30pm**

Don your dapperest tweed for our multi-city, multi-modal tiny tire extravaganza! Bromptons, Moultons, and all other small-wheel bicycles are welcome as we explore the valley using our bikes and lightrail!

We'll meet at [Civic Space Park](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/parks/alphabetical/c-parks/civic-space),
go for a short ride for drinks, then hop on the train for Tempe!

There, we will enjoy a short ride, stop for some libations or dinner, and hop a train to Mesa. We want to pack the train with our small-wheel bikes!

Folks who are small-wheel curious are welcome to bring their big wheel bikes along for the festivities!

We are so excited to collaborate with
[Tempe Bicycle Action Group](http://www.biketempe.org/),
[PortaPedal Bike](https://www.portapedalbike.com/), and
[Brompton Mafia](http://www.bromptonmafia.com/)
on this ride!
