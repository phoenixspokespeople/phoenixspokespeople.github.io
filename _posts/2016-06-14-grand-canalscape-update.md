ABOUT THE PROJECT

![map of project area](http://grandcanalscape.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Grand-Canalscape-Map-AG-Edits-R.3.png)

The project goals include developing a safe and efficient pathway for bicycle and pedestrian traffic along the canal bank, while integrating the canals into the surrounding communities.

* Phase I of the Grand Canalscape project will create a nearly 4-mile trail system along the Grand Canal that begins near 15th Avenue and Campbell Avenue continuing along the canal to 16th Street and Indian School Road. It resumes at 36th Street and Garfield and terminates near 40th Street and Van Buren Street. 
* Phase II of the Grand Canalscape project is composed of three segments located along the Grand Canal alignment: Segment One from I-17 to 15th Avenue, Segment Two from 16th Street to 36th Street, and Segment Three, beginning at 40th Street and terminating at the Phoenix/Tempe border at 56th Street.

The combined segments of Grand Canalscape Phase II total nearly eight miles of trail which will connect to the trail system developed in Phase I, creating a continuous multi-modal trail from I-17 to the Phoenix/Tempe border.
