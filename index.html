<p>
Phoenix Spokes People is a group of urban bicyclists dedicated to making Phoenix a friendlier, more welcoming place to ride a bike.
</p>

<p>
We believe that bicycling should be an easily accessible form of transportation for people of all ages, incomes and abilities.
</p>

<p>
We imagine a Phoenix with people dressed up or down - going to work or heading out for a night on the town - and getting there safely by riding in a proper bike lane.
