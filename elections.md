Greetings Phoenix Cyclists!

Are you interested in making Phoenix a friendlier, safer and easier place to ride a bike? Phoenix Spokes People (PSP) will be holding elections for our Board of Directors and we invite you to join us!

Board members meet regularly to discuss bicycle advocacy efforts in Phoenix and also attend public meetings including budget hearings, city council meetings, infrastructure open houses and meetings with the City of Phoenix Streets Transportation Department. The Board of Directors regularly drafts letters to the city with concerns, suggestions (and sometimes even praise) regarding bicycle infrastructure or other related issues.

Board members also participate in planning events and reaching out to businesses and other partners for collaboration. They are frequently interviewed by various media outlets, and may be quoted or appear in print, online, or televised news stories and features.

Our Board of Directors includes four executive positions:

* **President:** The President of Phoenix Spokes People presides at all meetings and has general charge and control of the affairs of Phoenix Spokes People, subject to such regulations and restrictions as the Board of Directors may impose.

* **Vice President**: The Vice President serves in the President's absence or in the event of the President's death, inability, or refusal to act. The Vice President has such powers and performs such duties as may be assigned to him or her by the President or by the Board of Directors.

* **Secretary**: The Secretary shall keep minutes, ensure all notices are duly given, have charge of all the corporate books and records, excluding such financial books as are the responsibility of the Treasurer, and other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the President or by the Board of Directors.

* **Treasurer**: The Treasurer shall have custody for all funds, financial transactions, file yearly income taxes, and other duties as may be assigned to him or her by the President or by the Board of Directors.

* Up to 10 **At-large Board Members** may also be filled. Some of these positions may have specific duties as assigned to him or her by the President or by the Board of Directors.

You must be a [Phoenix Spokes People member](//www.psp.bike/membership) to be eligible for a board position.

In the coming weeks we'll announce a call for candidates with a deadline via email to all PSP Members.

You may nominate yourself or someone else for a board position. Approximately two weeks after the call for candidates we'll hold an in-person election, with the location to be determined.

Thank you for all of your support in the early years of Phoenix Spokes People. We look forward to a long future of a Phoenix with people dressed up or down — going to work or heading out for a night on the town — and getting there safely by riding in a proper bike lane.
