title: "Businesses for Bikes!"

[Food for the Hungry, (FH)](https://fh.org/), an international non-profit with its headquarters right
here in Phoenix, AZ, offers a monetary benefit for their bicycle riders and public
transportation users. This can be used for bike-related and transit expenses to
provide financial assistance to people who use these transportation options.

*"We decided to enact the bike benefit program when Washington DC passed a law
requiring all businesses to provide financial assistance to their employees for
commuting using alternative transportation,"* said FH’s Chief Financial Officer and
Chief Operating Officer Barry Gardner.  The company implemented the program in
its Nashville and Phoenix offices to make them consistent with the program it offers
in Washington DC. FH began the program in January 2016.

Employees can decide on a monthly basis whether to use the mass transit or the
bike commute reimbursement. By federal law, they may not receive benefits for
both within the same month. The mass transit benefit is $130 a month, and the bike
benefit is $20 a month. The bike reimbursement must be for the bike only, so it can’t
be used for accessories like helmets.

Currently, most people would have bike commuted anyway.  Senior Coordinator of
Education Programs Mitzi Hanold in Washington DC has done this for 10 years and
says it provides *"great exercise, doesn't require a gym membership, and gives fresh
air and a good detox after a long day at work."*

Director of Public Policy and Advocacy Lucas Koch in DC, appreciates the benefit but
notes the program’s inequality. *"I can't recall the exact numbers, but non-bike
commuters get monthly close to what we get for the whole year,"* he
says. *"We incur significant housing costs to live close enough to be able to bike to the downtown
business district. At a 7 mile radius bike commute, it is the fastest, most reliable way
to and from the city during rush hour."*

While this bike benefit may not be perfect, it is a step in the right direction and
furthermore, rare. FH is a leader in its field, and other nonprofits and businesses
should follow its example.
