Hey Phoenix bicycle owners!

Did you know thieves are less likely to steal a registered bicycle since its owner can easily be identified.

Or, that bicycle registration aids in identifying the owner in case of a crash, as many bicyclists don’t carry ID, which is especially true of children. And, registering your bicycle increases the likelihood it will be returned to you if recovered.

With these facts in mind, the Evans Churchill Community Association, Phoenix Public Market, Phoenix Union Bioscience High School, and Phoenix Police Department are teaming up provide **FREE bicycle registration** for you, your family, and friends!

Just drop by the Phoenix Public Market and all will be taken care of.

Useful bicycle safety information, tchotchkes, and Q&A are also on tap!

Under the Evans Churchill tent, just look for friendly neighborhood and student volunteers – and City of Phoenix police officers who manage the City's bicycle registration program.

 **Third Saturday of every month** (except for summer) at the Public Market.
