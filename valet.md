## Explained

If there's one thing we can be sure of, it's that people would **love to ride a bike to your event**.

Unfortunately we're all familiar with the risk of locking up bicycles in public areas:
They're an easy target for thieves, especially if there are no dedicated bike racks available, or they are all filled up.

Phoenix Spokes People are _happy to offer a solution to this_:
Why not include a **bike valet** at your next event?

It works just like 'car valet':

- Attendees bring their bikes to our valet station where a volunteer will explain the process:
- We will take their bike and store it on a portable rack...
- attaching one half of one of our custom made claim checks to it
- and giving the other half to your event attendee.
- Each claim check has a unique number,
- so when they are ready to leave the event they'll exchange it for their bike.

## Our asks

We offer this service **free of charge**, but we'll need your help with a few things:

1. Be sure to advertise the presence of the bike valet across all media, we want to be sure that people we know they can easily park their bikes!
1. We'll need a secure area in which to set up. Temporary fences are perfect, but we can work around walls (e.g. in a parking lot) too.
1. The portable bike racks are kindly loaned to us by Valley Metro, so you'll need to complete [this form](/vm-bike-rack-loan-form.pdf).
1. If you can provide a table and chairs, and better yet a pop up tent, that'd be great.
1. Of course, any perks you can offer (e.g. tickets) would be much appreciated by our volunteers!

## Logistics

Our volunteers will arrive during set up time on the day of your event with Valley Metro's portable bike racks, we'll set up the racks, table, and signage.

We will stay until all the bikes are claimed, or it's obvious that someone has forgotten to claim theirs (see below).

With regard to **where to put the valet** and **how much space is required**:

- The portable racks we use are approx. 5 feet long, and each one holds approx. 8 bikes.
- We can scale up and down depending on available space.
- In the photo above you can see a 6 rack setup we did for Film Bar, that took up two parking spaces and allowed us to park approx. 50 bikes (at a squeeze).
- In the photo below you can our biggest valet to date, which we set up at Lost Lake Festival, with ample space and fencing we had over 300 bikes valeted at any one time.

## FAQ

1. _What happens to left over bikes?_

    Very occasionally we've had bikes left unclaimed when it's time for our volunteers to pack up.
    If this does happen, then we'll relocate them to [The Rusty Spoke](https://www.rustyspoke.org/), we've never had a case where a bike hasn't been claimed the next day.


1. _What happens if someone loses their claim check?_

    Our volunteers always ask people to take a photo of their claim check when they drop off a bike, just in case.

1. _How much space do we need?_

    Two regular car parking spaces (and room for a table) is the minimum size for it to be practical. We've found that (with sufficient advertising) we reach capacity more often than not, so the more space the better!

1. _Why do you and your volunteers do this?_

    Making contact with people who ride bikes is crucial to our goal of making Phoenix a friendlier, more welcoming place to ride a bike.
    We'll set up our table with additional information, and our volunteers are always eager to answer any questions people might have about riding a bike in Phoenix.
